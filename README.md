# Python Study - Start

This repository contains my initial journey in learning programming logic using Python. The exercises are based on platform [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br),
and the complementaries studies came from the books "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, "Python para Desenvolvedores" by Luiz Eduardo Borges.

## Solved Problems

| Problem | Name                          | What was learned:                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1001    | Extremely Basic               | Simple addition with int(),input() and print()          |
| 1002    | Area of a Circle              | Basic formulae using str(), format() and float()        |
| 1003    | Simple Sum                    | Simple sum, print() using f-strings                     |
| 1004    | Simple Product                | Simple product like the previous                        |
| 1005    | Average 1                     | Simple weighted average                                 |


## Goals

Develop a solid base in logic with Python, master in/outs, operators, conditions and initiate the use of versionation with Git and Github.

## Progress

The progress is documentated in file ['notes/brief.md'](./notes/brief/md), where is registred questions, what I learned e what I need to rethink.

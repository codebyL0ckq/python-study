# Brief

## Problem 1001
A simple adition between two numbers, but the input() receives as string so a used int() to transform to integer

## Problem 1002
Like problem 1002, just needed to tranform to float using float().
The print() was the problem when I want to present 4 float numbers after the point(.), so I used format() with similarity from C# when you use %.4f on printf();

## Problem 1003
I learned that using f-strings was more easy to print things. So the sum was made simple.

## Problem 1004
Like problem 1003, just changed the output SOMA to PROD and 'a+b' to 'a*b'
